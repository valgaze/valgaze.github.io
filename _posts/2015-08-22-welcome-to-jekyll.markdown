#Test 123

###Test 1234

Wow 2.0-- [prose.io](www.prose.io "Prose is amazing")


Some lessons:
1. Commiting and publishing is not instantaneous-- it takes a bit of time
2. If ANY of the frontmatter (date, etc) on a post is busted, then EVERYTHING breaks


Let's try some bullets:
- These are bullets1
- These are bullets2
- These are bullets3

Here's some javascript:
{% highlight javascript %}
0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3; //SHOCKINGLY returns false!!
{% endhighlight %}

__testing__

This should be *italics* This is 
You’ll [test] find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
