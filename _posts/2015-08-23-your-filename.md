## (MACOS) Sublime Text Keyboard Shortcuts that Aren't Overwhelming

The trouble with a full-fledged editor like sublime text is that if you look for keyboard shortcuts or commands, you'll quickly find all manner of magic incantations that will boost your efficiency. It's too much to learn.

Rather than bust them out all at once here are some "big wins." Once you master these and incorporate them in your workflow you can get to the special stuff.

#Shortcut #1: CMD-D: The elusive (and not that scary multi-cursor)
Imagine you find yourself in the situation where you've declared a bunch of variables and you want to add an _ flag to the front to communicate that they should be private:
{% highlight javascript %}
var theData = "what a great variable";
var theData2 = {wehave:"A great object here"};
var theData3 = ["this","is","a","GREAT","trick!"];
{% endhighlight %}

You *could* go item by item, but why not select them all at once.

1. Highlight the front of theData
2. HIT CMD-D
3. Keep hitting CMD-D and then it will select each matching item
